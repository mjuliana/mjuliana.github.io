My name is Matthew Juliana and I have been playing with computers most of my life. I've been in the tech industry for almost 25 years now. I have had a varity of roles from developer to DBA to architect and just about everything in between.

One of the phrases that I have uttered countless times throughout my career is "Let's try this". Regardless of my confidence or knowledge I find that taking a risk on trying something new helps to solve a lot of problems and even leads to innovation. 

The purpose of this blog is to share quick technical tidbits that I have tried over the years, as well as some new things that I have been trying out. Hopefully these will help you when your trying out something new.
